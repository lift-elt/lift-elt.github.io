LIFT ELT is a consortium of language education professionals. Founded by two former English learner teachers who are current literacy and language professors, LIFT ELT aims to provide space for professionals and educators concerned with improving education for multilingual learners to develop their knowledge and skills through free resources and webinars, bespoke in-house professional development, and partnership engagements tailored to your needs.
