Amber Warren and Natalia Ward began collaborating, presenting and publishing about pedagogy in 2007, while completing Master's degrees at the University of Tennessee, Knoxville. While working as English language teachers, they co-founded an after-school Book Club for English Learners, co-developed [multimodal projects to connect students' home and school communities](http://newsmanager.commpartners.com/tesolbeis/issues/2013-08-28/7.html), and [promoted students’ use of digital technologies in content-based instruction](https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&lr=&id=b3r-DwAAQBAJ&oi=fnd&pg=PT250&dq=amber+warren+natalia+ward+multiliteracies&ots=I07OAMlH19&sig=OBpg0rTTSnCd6kictIqyYFjtkZ0#v=onepage&q=amber%20warren%20natalia%20ward%20multiliteracies&f=false).

Their passion for professional development and supporting teachers who work with multilingual learners has resulted in nearly one-hundred presentations, and numerous publications, including a co-edited book. Today, they continue their work with aspiring and practicing teachers who support bilingual students all over the world. Every educational context is unique and requires its own solutions, specific to the skills and resources within the school community. Amber and Natalia customize each session when working with educators to address their learning goals.

Their areas of expertise include:

* Developing productive academic conversations in the classroom, including purposeful translanguaging opportunities and questioning and discussion techniques for deep learning
* Promoting meaningful use of digital tools for multimodal learning and teaching
* Improving literacy outcomes for emergent bilingual students at all stages of language acquisition including students who are dually identified for special education (e.g., word study, fluency, comprehension, writing)
* Establishing culturally and linguistically responsive approaches to tiered literacy instruction
* Supporting specific populations (students with interrupted formal schooling, newcomers, etc)
* Designing instruction to develop independent, self-driven learners
