## TESOL Italy Presentation

Slides from our 2023 session at TESOL Italy, on advocacy and activism in language teaching and language teacher education. This presentation includes reference to some work from our upcoming edited manuscript, *Activism in Language Teaching and Language Teacher Education*. We are grateful to the educators who shared their research and their pedagogy with us. Their work inspires us, and we hope it may inspire you too.

### More than just teaching: Advocacy and activism around the globe
